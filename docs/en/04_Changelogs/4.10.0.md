## Regression test and Security audit{#audit}

This release has been comprehensively regression tested and passed to a third party for a security-focused audit. 

While it is still advised that you perform your own due diligence when upgrading your project, this work is performed to ensure a safe and secure upgrade with each recipe release.

## Dropping support for PHP 7.1 and PHP 7.2{#phpeol}

We've recently updated our [PHP support policy](/Getting_Started/Server_Requirements#php). The immediate affects of this changes are:

- The Silverstripe CMS Recipe release 4.10.0 drops support for PHP 7.1 and PHP 7.2. Those two PHP releases have been end-of-life for several years now and continued support would detract effort from more valuable work.
- The 4.11 minor release will drop support for PHP 7.3 later this year.
- We expect to drop support for PHP 7 altogether around January 2023.
